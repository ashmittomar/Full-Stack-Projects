      <h2>Nature’s ID Card</h2>
      <p>
        Every species of plant and animal carries its own official “identity” through scientific and common names. Just like Hibiscus rosa-sinensis (China rose) or Elephas maximus (Asian elephant), these names prevent confusion and ensure correct identification for research and conservation.

      <h2>The Global Language of Species</h2>
      <p>
        While common names vary—like Indian peafowl, “mor,” or “mayil”—the scientific name Pavo cristatus speaks universally. This global recognition helps scientists, farmers, and conservationists coordinate across borders without miscommunication.

      <h2>Stories Behind the Names</h2>
      <p>
        Many names carry centuries of meaning. The lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) stands for purity in many Asian cultures, while the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is a symbol of strength and biodiversity. Some names even reveal ecological roles—like “honeybee” hinting at pollination and honey production.
